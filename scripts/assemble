# Fixup file system permissions. Normally for an S2I build we would make
# files/directories under /opt/app-root writable by group so that the
# application can write can do updates still when run as arbitrary user
# ID. For CTFd we want to avoid the possibility that someone could break
# into the application and modify source code and then trigger a restart
# of the web server. We thus remove write access to group and others.
# This can result in a new layer being created in the container image,
# but removing write access is worth the extra image size.
